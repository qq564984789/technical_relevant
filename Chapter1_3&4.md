This kind of thinking is called reflective because it takes life as its object.
> * 背景：冯友兰受西方哲学教育影响，全书使用西方哲学写作架构来叙述，内容是中国的。
> * object:客体——在主体之外的都是客体。 subject:主体     反思： 把生活看成一个客体
> * 佛家内观（Introspection）：将自己从肉身抽离出来看自己的内心，将自己的内心当成客体来看，进入mindful的状态

The theory of life, the theory of the universe, and the theory of knowledge all emerge from this type of thinking.
> * life:生命,引申为大道            universe：宇宙，引申为起源——生命的背景,环境          knowledge:知识，见地——对生命的认知

The theory of the universe arises because the universe is the background of life—the stage on which the drama of life takes place.
> * drama:['drɑmə]  n. 戏剧
   
The theory of knowledge emerges because thinking is itself knowledge. 
> * emerge:浮现      I think, therefore I am.
According to some philosophers of the West, in order to think, we must first find out what we can think; that is to say, before we start to think about life, we must first think our thinking.Such theories are all the products of reflective thinking. 
> * think our thinking:反思之思       
> * 哲学爱好者的原则：没有反思的生活是不值得过的，但是一直反思的生活是没法过的.    一直反思的生活是哲学家过的。
> * 中国哲学的强大在于实践！

The very concept of life, the very concept of the universe, and the very concept of knowledge are also the products of reflective thinking.
> * very:adj.恰好、正是。用于特指

No matter whether we think about life or whether we talk about it, we are all in the midst of it. 
> *  in the midst of :在....之中    [mɪtst]

And no matter whether we think or speak about the universe, we are all a part of it.Now, what the philosophers call the universe is not the same as what the physicists have in mind when they refer to it.What the philosophers call the universe is the totality of all that is.
> * totality： n.整体、全部  [toʊˈtæləti]                               抽象思考是人的一种理性本能

It is equivalent to what the ancient Chinese philosopher, Hui Shih, called "The Great One," which is defined as that which has nothing beyond. 
> * It：指代上文中的the universe                                          The Great One:大道（one就是唯一） 
> * which has nothing beyond:(宇宙)没有其他东西在它之外/超过它。

So everyone  and everything must be considered part of the universe. When one thinks about the universe, one is thinking reflectively.
