## Place of Philosophy in Chinese Civilization

To the Westerner, who sees that the life of the Chinese people is permeated with Confucianism, it appears that Confucianism is a religion.
> * Westerner:首字母大写，表泛指。To the Westerner表明整句话的话锋指向西方人。
> *  who sees that的 see:认为
> * permeated:['pɝmɪet] 分散，布满    be permeated with = be full of

As a matter of fact, however, Confucianism is no more a religion than, say, Pla-tonism or Aristotelianism.
> * As a matter of fact = Factually = In fact
> * however跟在As a matter of fact后面，表一个更强调的转折
> * A  is no more a religion than B: 表面翻译-A不比B多一点宗教  。真正意思：A和B一样，都不是宗教
> * He is no wiser than his brother:他和他弟弟一样，都不聪明。  A no + 比较级 than B：意思是比较级的取反。(no在这里其否定的意思)
> * say：插入语，等同于 for example
> * platonism:['pleitənizəm] n. 柏拉图主义；   Aristotelianism：[,æristə'ti:ljənizəm] n. 亚里斯多德学说
> * 古希腊哲学的中轴——3个人：苏格拉底、柏拉图、亚里士多德

It is true that the Four Books have been the Bible of the Chinese people, but in the Four Books there is no story of creation, and no mention of a heaven or hell.
> * It is true that: 这么说是对的....        该句型用来让步，先把语气收回来，为后面but埋下伏笔
> * no story of creation:没有创世纪

Of course, the terms philosophy and religion are both ambiguous.Philosophy and religion may have entirely different meanings for different people.When men talk about philosophy or religion, they may have quite different ideas in their minds concerning them.
> * ambiguous:模糊的    entirely：完全。表示强调         整个三句话在这里打太极，把哲学和宗教搞混。
> * 背景：上世纪50年代西方分析哲学兴盛，分析哲学要探究的是人类的语言到底能否表达每个人要表达的意思。

For my part, what I call philosophy is systematic, reflective thinking on life. 
> * 作者说，我所谓的哲学，是以下三个关键词：
> * systematic  :系统性
> * reflective thinking：反思    reflective ：adj 反射的。
> * life

Every man, who has not yet died, is in life. But there are not many who think reflectively on life, and still fewer whose reflective thinking is systematic.
> * 先从life来谈，再谈think reflectively on lif，最后再谈systematic，整句从反面来讲不具备think reflectively on life和reflective thinking is systematic.的不是哲学家

A philosopher must philosophize;  that is to say, he must think reflectively on life, and then express his thoughts systematically.
> * philosophize:[fə'lɑsəfaɪz]  vi. 进行哲学探讨，理性地思考,哲思。
> * 这句话从正面表明了什么是一个哲学家：1、think reflectively on life 反思生活   2、express his thoughts systematically  系统表达

## 无需期待成为哲学家，只要让哲学在自己身上发生，成为生活的哲学家即可。
