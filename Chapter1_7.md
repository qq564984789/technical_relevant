 If one understands the term religion in this sense, which does not really differ very much from common usage, one sees that Confucianism cannot be considered a religion. 
> * 儒家为什么不是宗教呢？论语中说"子不语怪力乱神"
 
People have been accustomed to say that there were three religions in China: Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. But Confucianism, as we have seen, is not a religion. As to Taoism, there is a distinction between Taoism as a philosophy, which is called Tao chia (the Taoist school), and the Taoist religion {Tao chiao). 
      
Their teachings are not only different   
> *   teachings：教化

Taoism as a philosophy teaches the doctrine of following nature, while Taoism as a religion teaches the doctrine of working against nature.
> * Taoism：道家   主张道法自然    
> * 道教

For instance, according to Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu, life followed by death is the course of nature, and man should follow this natural course calmly. 
> * life followed by death:生之后，为死

But the main teaching of the Taoist'religion is the principle and technique of how to avoid death, which is expressly working against nature. The Taoist religion has the spirit of science, which is the conquering of nature. If one is interested in the history of Chinese science, the writings of the religious Taoists will supply mnch information.

As to Buddhism, there is also the distinction between Buddhism as a philosophy, which is called Fo hsueh (the Buddhist learning),and Buddhism as a religion, which is called Fa chiao (the Buddhist religion). To the educated Chinese, Buddhist philosophy is much more interesting than the Buddhist religion. It is quite common to see both Buddhist monks and Taoist monks simultaneously participating in Chinese funeral services. The Chinese people take even their religion philosophically.
> * 中国的葬礼上，佛教的和尚和道教的道士可以在同一个场合行事。在西游记中，玉皇大帝边上既可以有太上老君，也可以有观音菩萨，如来等。因此，本质上中国人对宗教的严谨性，排他性没有忌讳。只要能为我所用，解决实际问题就可以。因此，中国的宗教没有西方宗教的排他性，反而表现出互容行，圆融，调和。
