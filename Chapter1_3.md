This kind of thinking is called reflective because it takes life as its object.

The theory of life, the theory of the universe, and the theory of knowledge all emerge from this type of thinking.

The theory of the universe arises because the universe is the background of life—the stage on which the drama of life takes place.

The theory of knowledge emerges because thinking is itself knowledge. 
According to some philosophers of the West, in order to think, we must first find out what we can think; that is to say, before we start to think about life, we must first think our thinking.Such theories are all the products of reflective thinking. 
The very concept of life, the very concept of the universe, and the very concept of knowledge are also the products of reflective thinking.
No matter whether we think about life or whether we talk about it, we are all in the midst of it. 
And no matter whether we think or speak about the universe, we are all a part of it.
Now, what the philosophers call the universe is not the same as what the physicists have in mind when they refer to it.
What the philosophers call the universe is the totality of all that is.
