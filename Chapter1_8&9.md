At present it is known to many Westerners that the Chinese people have been less concerned with religion than other people are. For instance, in one of his articles, "Dominant Ideas in the Formation of Chinese Culture," Professor Derk Boddc says: "They [the Chinese]
are not a people for whom religious ideas and activities constitute an all important and absorbing part of life.... It is ethics (especially Confucian ethics), and not religion (at least not religion of a formal,organized type), that provided the spiritual basis in Chinese civilization.... All of which, of course, marks a difference of fundamental importance between China and most other major civilizations, in which a church and a priesthood have played a dominant role_"

In one sense this is quite true. But one may ask: Why is this so? If the craving for what is beyond the present actual world is not one of
the innate desires of mankind, why is it a fact that for most people religious ideas and activities constitute an all-important and absorbing
part of life? If that craving is one of the fundamental desires of mankind, why should the Chinese people be an exception? When one says that it is ethics, not religion, that has provided the spiritual basis of
Chinese civilization, does it imply that the Chinese are not conscious of those values which are higher than moral ones?
