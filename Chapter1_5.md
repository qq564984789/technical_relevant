When we think about knowledge or speak about knowledge, this thinking and speaking are themselves knowledge. To use an expression of Aristotle, it is "thinking on thinking"; and this is reflective thinking. 

Here is the **vicious circle** which those philosophers follow who insist that before we  think we must first think about our thinking;just as if we had another faculty with which we could think about thinking!   
> * vicious:['vɪʃəs] adj. 恶毒的；恶意的；   vicious circle:恶性循环         faculty：工具,能力
> * just as if:就好像...       这个开头，颇有举重若轻的感觉，和下面的冯友兰开启自己的观点As a matter of fact形成对比。
      
As a matter of fact, the faculty with which we think about thinking is the very same faculty with which we think. 
> * 冯友兰用As a matter of fact的句式开启自己的观点，用来和上面的观点区别开来。      冯友兰的意思：反思之思使用的工具和思考使用的工具是同一个。

If we are skeptical about the capacity of our thinking in regard to life and the universe, we have the same reason to be skeptical about the capacity of our thinking in regard to thinking.
> * 反思之思不能成立，原因是思考本身不能被怀疑。“我思，故我在  ” ——思考本身不能被怀疑，这是哲学讨论的起点。中国哲学一开始就有别于欧陆哲学，将反思之思的问题搁置。
> * 西方直到康德才将次问题解决。用一个哲学界公认的比喻:康德是一个蓄水池。康德之前，所有的哲学都在他这里汇集 ；康德之后，所有的哲学都从他这里流出。
> * 中国哲学：少谈主义，多谈问题。面向人间，解决实际问题     欧陆哲学：反思，反思，反思....（黑格尔，康德等德国古典哲学），直到叔本华     
> * 英美哲学：一开始就比较关注现实问题
